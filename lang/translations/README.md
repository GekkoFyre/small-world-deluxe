## Translations for Small World Deluxe

Hello! This folder is the future holding site for all the translation files for the [Small World Deluxe](https://code.gekkofyre.io/amateur-radio/small-world-deluxe) project. We are looking for multi-lingual writers and speakers to fill this role, primarily for the [EFIGS languages](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/EFIGS) at first. Although we aren't a group to knock back anyone willing to translate towards a particular language of their offering if it's something other than English, we're just gracious either way.

The best way to contact the author, Phobos D'thorga, about interest in this area is via the [Discord chat application](https://discord.com/), where you'll need to find the username, `Phobos#0001`. I do appear offline most of the time but that by no means that I'm not generally available most days and times. So send me a message and I should contact you back as soon as possible, thank you :)
