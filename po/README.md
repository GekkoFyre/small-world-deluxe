# Translation of Dekoder for Morse

Hello there!

You seemed to have found where we keep our multilingual translations with regard to [Dekoder for Morse](https://git.gekkofyre.io/amateur-radio/dekoder-for-morse). Because so few of us in the world our multilingual, and even fewer whom are both that while retaining good computing skills simultaneously, we have to reach out to the community at large in order to get this project translated in languages other than the speech of world trade and commerce; English.

If you would like to assist with the transliteration of Dekoder, which not only would we be <u>*sincerely*</u> appreciative of, but you would also be obtaining a mark/seal of real world experience to show to potential employers!

We'd only be too happy to assist with any of your job finding needs, since it's the least we can do to say thank you for the time and dedication you will have given us. Given that you are interested, please contact the lead programmer at **phobos[dot]gekko[at]gekkofyre[dot]io**, thank you :)
